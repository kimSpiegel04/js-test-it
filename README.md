# js-test-it
Test your JavaScript in the browser: https://kimspiegel04.github.io/js-test-it/

Built with CodeMirror

Enter code in the code editor on the left of the screen. After pressing the 'Run >' button, the output will show up in the grey box on the right. 

Current issues: 
1. Anything console.log'ged will show up in the browser console and the output text area will display 'undefined'

Future versions:
1. A user would be able to log in and push code to Github Gists (if this is possible??) - perfect for coding challenges!!
2. The output text area would be constantly updated (think freecodecamp rather than w3 schools)
3. User would be able to switch themes, tab preference, and perhaps languages
